The goal here is to do a backup of the mongodb from a running old FlowBAT instance and
then restore that backup into the new fresh instance. To do that, you'll need to make sure
to do the backup of the old instance before installing the new instance. Afterwards you can 
kill all meteor processes that are running with FlowBAT (probably a meteor node command 
and mongo db command.) Once they are dead, you can install the new FlowBAT using the new 
install script. After it is installed and running, you can drop its database, then restore
the backup to the previous dropped location.

tl;dr

If FlowBAT isn't already running then manually cd to the FlowBAT project directory and 
start meteor dev so that you can grab a copy of the db.
# meteor --port 1800 run --settings settings/dev.json "$@"

Create a safe place to copy the db.
# mkdir ~/fbdevbackup

Dump the db from the meteor dev instance of FlowBAT to ~/fbdevbackup
# mongodump -h 127.0.0.1 --port 1801 -d meteor -o ~/fbdevbackup

Install the new FlowBAT
# ./install_flowbat_ubuntu.sh

Check that it is running (should have node main.js)
#ps aux | grep node

Remove the current prod database in the running node instance.
# mongo flowbat --eval "db.dropDatabase()"

Restore the dev backup to the prod node instance.
# mongorestore -h 127.0.0.1:27017 -d flowbat ~/fbdevbackup/meteor/

Manually remove backup DB and location (optional)
# rm -rf ~/fbdevbackup
